# Uber: Predictive Models

This project implements a complete predictive modeling and analysis flow applied to Uber Eats delivery data. It goes from data loading and cleaning, through visual exploration with matplotlib and seaborn, to building regression models (Lasso and Random Forest) to predict Average Time to Delivery (ATD). It includes transformations of categorical and numerical variables, feature engineering (such as circular variables for time) and model evaluation using metrics such as MSE and adjusted RÂ².
